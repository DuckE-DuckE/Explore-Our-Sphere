    <h2 id="J-Head">Japan</h2>
    <p>Japan is a culturally rich and technologically advanced island nation in East Asia, featuring four main islands including Honshu and Kyushu, with Tokyo as its capital. Its history, influenced by China, evolved from ancient times through a samurai-led feudal era to rapid modernization after the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Post-World War II, Japan adopted pacifism and transformed into a global economic powerhouse, with a strong presence in the automotive, electronics, and entertainment industries. Despite facing demographic challenges and natural disaster risks, Japan's blend of traditional and modern culture, from tea ceremonies to anime, continues to have a significant global impact.</p>
